  python /app/your_script.py
```

### Development with Docker

For development purposes, you can use the provided development script:

```bash
# Start the development environment
./dev.sh
```

This script will:
1. Create necessary directories (data, logs, test-results)
2. Create a default .env.dev file if it doesn't exist
3. Start the Docker development environment using docker-compose.dev.yml
4. Show logs from the containers

See the [Docker Usage](docs/getting_started.md#docker-usage) and [Development with Docker](docs/getting_started.md#development-with-docker) sections in the documentation for more details.

## Quick Start

For new developers, see the [QUICKSTART.md](QUICKSTART.md) guide for step-by-step instructions to get up and running quickly.

```python
from fogis_api_client import FogisApiClient, FogisLoginError, FogisAPIRequestError, configure_logging

# Configure logging with enhanced options
configure_logging(level="INFO")

# Initialize with credentials
client = FogisApiClient(username="your_username", password="your_password")

# Fetch matches (lazy login happens automatically)
try:
    matches = client.fetch_matches_list_json()
    print(f"Found {len(matches)} matches")

    # Display the next 3 matches
    for match in matches[:3]:
        print(f"{match['datum']} {match['tid']}: {match['hemmalag']} vs {match['bortalag']} at {match['arena']}")

except FogisLoginError as e:
    print(f"Authentication error: {e}")
except FogisAPIRequestError as e:
    print(f"API request error: {e}")
```

## Documentation

Comprehensive documentation is available in the [docs](docs/) directory:

* [Getting Started Guide](docs/getting_started.md)
* [API Reference](docs/api_reference.md)
* [User Guides](docs/user_guides/)
* [Architecture Overview](docs/architecture.md)
* [Troubleshooting](docs/troubleshooting.md)

#### Usage

```python
import logging
from fogis_api_client.fogis_api_client import FogisApiClient, FogisLoginError, FogisAPIRequestError

logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO)

username = "your_fogis_username"
password = "your_fogis_password"

try:
    client = FogisApiClient(username, password)
    # No need to call login() explicitly - the client implements lazy login
    matches = client.fetch_matches_list_json()
    if matches:
        print(f"Found {len(matches)} matches.")
    else:
        print("No matches found.")
except FogisLoginError as e:
    print(f"Login failed: {e}")
except FogisAPIRequestError as e:
    print(f"API request error: {e}")
except Exception as e:
    print(f"An unexpected error occurred: {e}")
```

You can also call `login()` explicitly if you want to pre-authenticate:

```python
client = FogisApiClient(username, password)
client.login()  # Explicitly authenticate
# ... make API requests
```

#### Cookie-Based Authentication

For improved security, you can authenticate using cookies instead of storing credentials:

```python
# First, get cookies from a logged-in session
client = FogisApiClient(username, password)
client.login()
cookies = client.get_cookies()  # Save these cookies securely

# Later, in another session, use the saved cookies
client = FogisApiClient(cookies=cookies)
# No need to call login() - already authenticated with cookies
matches = client.fetch_matches_list_json()
```

You can validate if the cookies are still valid:

```python
client = FogisApiClient(cookies=cookies)
if client.validate_cookies():
    print("Cookies are valid")
else:
    print("Cookies have expired, need to login with credentials again")
```

#### Contributing

Contributions are welcome! Please follow these steps:

1. Fork the repository
2. Create a feature branch: `git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name`
3. Make your changes
4. Run the pre-merge check to ensure all tests pass:
   ```bash
   ./pre-merge-check.sh
   ```
5. Commit your changes: `git commit -m "Add your feature"`
6. Push to the branch: `git push origin feature/your-feature-name`
7. Create a pull request

#### Development Setup

We provide setup scripts to make it easy to set up your development environment, including pre-commit hooks.

##### Using the Setup Script

On macOS/Linux:
```bash
./scripts/setup_dev_env.sh
```

On Windows (PowerShell):
```powershell
.\scripts\setup_dev_env.ps1
```

This script will:
1. Create a virtual environment (if it doesn't exist)
2. Install the package in development mode with all dev dependencies
3. Install pre-commit and set up the hooks

##### Manual Setup

If you prefer to set up manually:

1. Create and activate a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv .venv
   source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

2. Install the package in development mode:
   ```bash
   pip install -e ".[dev]"
   ```

3. Install pre-commit hooks:
   ```bash
   pip install pre-commit
   pre-commit install
   ```

##### Pre-Commit Hooks

We use pre-commit hooks to ensure code quality. The hooks will automatically run before each commit, checking for:
- Code formatting (Black, isort)
- Linting issues (flake8)
- Type checking (mypy)
- Unit test failures

You can also run the hooks manually on all files:
```bash
pre-commit run --all-files
```

##### Verifying Docker Builds Locally

Before pushing changes that might affect Docker builds, you can verify them locally:

```bash
# Run the Docker verification hook
pre-commit run docker-verify --hook-stage manual

# Or run the script directly
./scripts/verify_docker_build.sh
```

This will build all Docker images locally and ensure they work correctly, preventing CI/CD pipeline failures.

##### Running Integration Tests

To run integration tests locally before pushing changes:

```bash
# Run the integration tests script
./scripts/run_integration_tests.sh
```

This script will:
1. Set up a virtual environment if needed
2. Install dependencies
3. Run the integration tests with the mock server

Running integration tests locally helps catch issues before they reach the CI/CD pipeline.

##### Dynamic Pre-commit Hook Generator

This project uses a dynamic pre-commit hook generator powered by Google's Gemini LLM to maintain consistent code quality and documentation standards.

```bash
# Generate pre-commit hooks interactively
python3 scripts/dynamic_precommit_generator.py

# Generate pre-commit hooks non-interactively
python3 scripts/dynamic_precommit_generator.py --non-interactive --install
```

See [scripts/README_DYNAMIC_HOOKS.md](scripts/README_DYNAMIC_HOOKS.md) for detailed documentation.

##### Pre-Merge Check

Before merging any changes, always run the pre-merge check script to ensure all tests pass:

```bash
./pre-merge-check.sh
```

This script:
- Runs all unit tests
- Builds and tests the Docker image (if Docker is available)
- Ensures your changes won't break existing functionality

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues while using the FOGIS API Client, check the [Troubleshooting Guide](docs/troubleshooting.md) for solutions to common problems.

### Common Issues

1. **Authentication Failures**
   - Check your credentials
   - Verify your account is active
   - Ensure you have the necessary permissions

2. **API Request Errors**
   - Check your network connection
   - Verify the FOGIS API is accessible
   - Ensure your request parameters are valid

3. **Data Errors**
   - Verify that the requested resource exists
   - Check for API changes
   - Ensure your data is properly formatted

4. **Match Reporting Issues**
   - Ensure all required fields are included
   - Verify that the match is in a reportable state
   - Check that player and team IDs are correct

5. **Performance Issues**
   - Implement caching for frequently accessed data
   - Use more specific queries to reduce data size
   - Process large data sets in chunks

## Error Handling

The package includes custom exceptions for common API errors:

- **FogisLoginError**: Raised when login fails due to invalid credentials, missing credentials, or session expiration.

- **FogisAPIRequestError**: Raised for general API request errors such as network issues, server errors, or invalid parameters.

- **FogisDataError**: Raised when there's an issue with the data from FOGIS, such as invalid response format, missing fields, or parsing errors.
