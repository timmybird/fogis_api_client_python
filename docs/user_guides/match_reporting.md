# Match Reporting Guide

This guide provides step-by-step instructions for reporting match events, results, and completing match reports using the FOGIS API Client.

## Prerequisites

- FOGIS API Client installed
- Valid FOGIS credentials with referee permissions
- Match ID for the match you want to report

## Step 1: Initialize the Client and Authenticate

First, initialize the FOGIS API Client and authenticate:

```python
import logging
from fogis_api_client import FogisApiClient, FogisLoginError, FogisAPIRequestError

# Configure logging
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO)

# Initialize the client
username = "your_fogis_username"
password = "your_fogis_password"

try:
    client = FogisApiClient(username, password)
    client.login()  # Explicitly authenticate
    print("Authentication successful")
except FogisLoginError as e:
    print(f"Authentication failed: {e}")
    exit(1)
```

## Step 2: Fetch Match Details

Before reporting events, it's a good idea to fetch the match details to ensure you have the correct match ID and to get information about the teams:

```python
match_id = 123456  # Replace with your match ID

try:
    match = client.fetch_match_json(match_id)
    print(f"Match: {match['hemmalag']} vs {match['bortalag']}")
    print(f"Date: {match['datum']}")
    print(f"Venue: {match['arena']}")

    # Store team IDs for later use
    home_team_id = match['hemmalagid']
    away_team_id = match['bortalagid']

except FogisAPIRequestError as e:
    print(f"Failed to fetch match details: {e}")
    exit(1)
```

## Step 3: Fetch Players

To report player-specific events (like goals or cards), you need to fetch the player information:

```python
try:
    players = client.fetch_match_players_json(match_id)

    home_players = players.get('hemmalag', [])
    away_players = players.get('bortalag', [])

    print(f"Home team has {len(home_players)} players")
    print(f"Away team has {len(away_players)} players")

    # Print player information for reference
    print("\nHome Team Players:")
    for player in home_players:
        print(f"ID: {player['personid']}, Name: {player['fornamn']} {player['efternamn']}, Number: {player.get('tshirt', 'N/A')}")

    print("\nAway Team Players:")
    for player in away_players:
        print(f"ID: {player['personid']}, Name: {player['fornamn']} {player['efternamn']}, Number: {player.get('tshirt', 'N/A')}")

except FogisAPIRequestError as e:
    print(f"Failed to fetch players: {e}")
    exit(1)
```

## Step 4: Report Match Events

Now you can report match events such as goals, cards, and substitutions:

### Reporting a Goal

```python
# Example: Report a goal by a home team player
goal_event = {
    "matchid": match_id,
    "handelsekod": 6,  # Regular goal (see EVENT_TYPES for other goal types)
    "minut": 35,  # Minute when the goal was scored
    "lagid": home_team_id,
    "personid": home_players[0]['personid'],  # ID of the player who scored
    "period": 1,  # 1 for first half, 2 for second half
    "resultatHemma": 1,  # Updated score for home team
    "resultatBorta": 0   # Updated score for away team
}

try:
    response = client.report_match_event(goal_event)
    if response.get('success', False):
        print(f"Goal reported successfully. Event ID: {response.get('matchhandelseid')}")
    else:
        print("Failed to report goal")
except (FogisAPIRequestError, FogisDataError) as e:
    print(f"Error reporting goal: {e}")
```

### Reporting a Yellow Card

```python
# Example: Report a yellow card for an away team player
card_event = {
    "matchid": match_id,
    "handelsekod": 20,  # Yellow card
    "minut": 42,
    "lagid": away_team_id,
    "personid": away_players[0]['personid'],
    "period": 1
}

try:
    response = client.report_match_event(card_event)
    if response.get('success', False):
        print(f"Yellow card reported successfully. Event ID: {response.get('matchhandelseid')}")
    else:
        print("Failed to report yellow card")
except (FogisAPIRequestError, FogisDataError) as e:
    print(f"Error reporting yellow card: {e}")
```

### Reporting a Substitution

```python
# Example: Report a substitution for the home team
substitution_event = {
    "matchid": match_id,
    "handelsekod": 17,  # Substitution
    "minut": 65,
    "lagid": home_team_id,
    "personid": home_players[1]['personid'],  # Player coming on
    "assisterandeid": home_players[0]['personid'],  # Player going off
    "period": 2
}

try:
    response = client.report_match_event(substitution_event)
    if response.get('success', False):
        print(f"Substitution reported successfully. Event ID: {response.get('matchhandelseid')}")
    else:
        print("Failed to report substitution")
except (FogisAPIRequestError, FogisDataError) as e:
    print(f"Error reporting substitution: {e}")
```

## Step 5: Report Match Result

After reporting all events, you need to report the final match result:

```python
# Example: Report a 2-1 result with 1-0 at halftime
result_data = {
    "matchid": match_id,
    "hemmamal": 2,  # Full-time home team score
    "bortamal": 1,  # Full-time away team score
    "halvtidHemmamal": 1,  # Half-time home team score
    "halvtidBortamal": 0   # Half-time away team score
}

try:
    response = client.report_match_result(result_data)
    if response.get('success', False):
        print("Match result reported successfully")
    else:
        print("Failed to report match result")
except (FogisAPIRequestError, FogisDataError) as e:
    print(f"Error reporting match result: {e}")
```

## Step 6: Mark Reporting as Finished

The final step is to mark the match reporting as finished:

```python
try:
    response = client.mark_reporting_finished(match_id)
    if response.get('success', False):
        print("Match reporting marked as finished successfully")
    else:
        print("Failed to mark match reporting as finished")
except (FogisAPIRequestError, FogisDataError) as e:
    print(f"Error marking match reporting as finished: {e}")
```

## Complete Example

Here's a complete example that puts all the steps together:

```python
import logging
from fogis_api_client import FogisApiClient, FogisLoginError, FogisAPIRequestError, FogisDataError

# Configure logging
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO)

# Initialize the client
username = "your_fogis_username"
password = "your_fogis_password"
match_id = 123456  # Replace with your match ID

try:
    # Step 1: Initialize and authenticate
    client = FogisApiClient(username, password)
    client.login()
    print("Authentication successful")

    # Step 2: Fetch match details
    match = client.fetch_match_json(match_id)
    print(f"Match: {match['hemmalag']} vs {match['bortalag']}")
    home_team_id = match['hemmalagid']
    away_team_id = match['bortalagid']

    # Step 3: Fetch players
    players = client.fetch_match_players_json(match_id)
    home_players = players.get('hemmalag', [])
    away_players = players.get('bortalag', [])

    # Step 4: Report match events

    # First half events
    # Home team goal at 35'
    goal1_event = {
        "matchid": match_id,
        "handelsekod": 6,  # Regular goal
        "minut": 35,
        "lagid": home_team_id,
        "personid": home_players[0]['personid'],
        "period": 1,
        "resultatHemma": 1,
        "resultatBorta": 0
    }
    client.report_match_event(goal1_event)
    print("First goal reported")

    # Away team yellow card at 42'
    card_event = {
        "matchid": match_id,
        "handelsekod": 20,  # Yellow card
        "minut": 42,
        "lagid": away_team_id,
        "personid": away_players[0]['personid'],
        "period": 1
    }
    client.report_match_event(card_event)
    print("Yellow card reported")

    # Second half events
    # Home team substitution at 65'
    sub_event = {
        "matchid": match_id,
        "handelsekod": 17,  # Substitution
        "minut": 65,
        "lagid": home_team_id,
        "personid": home_players[1]['personid'],  # Player coming on
        "assisterandeid": home_players[0]['personid'],  # Player going off
        "period": 2
    }
    client.report_match_event(sub_event)
    print("Substitution reported")

    # Home team second goal at 75'
    goal2_event = {
        "matchid": match_id,
        "handelsekod": 6,  # Regular goal
        "minut": 75,
        "lagid": home_team_id,
        "personid": home_players[1]['personid'],
        "period": 2,
        "resultatHemma": 2,
        "resultatBorta": 0
    }
    client.report_match_event(goal2_event)
    print("Second goal reported")

    # Away team goal at 85'
    goal3_event = {
        "matchid": match_id,
        "handelsekod": 6,  # Regular goal
        "minut": 85,
        "lagid": away_team_id,
        "personid": away_players[0]['personid'],
        "period": 2,
        "resultatHemma": 2,
        "resultatBorta": 1
    }
    client.report_match_event(goal3_event)
    print("Third goal reported")

    # Step 5: Report match result
    result_data = {
        "matchid": match_id,
        "hemmamal": 2,
        "bortamal": 1,
        "halvtidHemmamal": 1,
        "halvtidBortamal": 0
    }
    client.report_match_result(result_data)
    print("Match result reported")

    # Step 6: Mark reporting as finished
    client.mark_reporting_finished(match_id)
    print("Match reporting marked as finished")

    print("Match reporting completed successfully")

except FogisLoginError as e:
    print(f"Authentication failed: {e}")
except FogisAPIRequestError as e:
    print(f"API request error: {e}")
except FogisDataError as e:
    print(f"Data error: {e}")
except Exception as e:
    print(f"Unexpected error: {e}")
```

## Tips and Best Practices

1. **Always verify match details** before reporting events to ensure you're working with the correct match.
2. **Report events in chronological order** to maintain consistency in the match timeline.
3. **Update scores correctly** when reporting goals to ensure the final result matches the reported goals.
4. **Handle errors gracefully** to prevent incomplete match reports.
5. **Test with non-production matches** if possible before using in real matches.
6. **Save event IDs** returned from the API to allow for corrections if needed.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Authentication Failures**
   - Ensure your username and password are correct
   - Check if your account has the necessary permissions

2. **Missing Player Information**
   - Ensure the match has been properly set up in FOGIS
   - Verify that team rosters have been submitted

3. **Event Reporting Failures**
   - Check that all required fields are included in the event data
   - Ensure player IDs are correct
   - Verify that the event type code is valid

4. **Result Reporting Failures**
   - Ensure the reported goals match the final result
   - Check that both full-time and half-time scores are included

5. **Unable to Mark Reporting as Finished**
   - Ensure all required match information has been reported
   - Check for any validation errors in the match report
